<h1>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h1>

HTML is a markup language that is used to create and structure content on the web, such as text, images, and multimedia.

In HTML, you define elements that represent different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
You use tags to define these elements, and then nest them inside each other to create a structured hierarchy.

For example, here's an example of HTML code that creates a simple webpage:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to go to Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```
