# Openai https://openai.com/api/
OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab consisting of the for-profit OpenAI LP and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc. It aims to create and promote friendly AI in a way that benefits humanity as a whole.

**installation**
To use OpenAI's API, you will need to sign up for an API key at https://beta.openai.com/signup/
Once you have an API key, you can install the OpenAI python library by running the following command:
pip install openai

**Usage**
To use the OpenAI API, you will need to import the openai module and set your API key:
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

You can then use the 'openai.Completion.create()' function to generate text completion,
the 'openai.ImageCompletion.create()' function to generate image completion and openai.Davinci.create() function to generate text completion with high-quality human-like text.

For example, to generate a completion for the prompt "What is the capital of France?", you can use the following code:
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt="What is the capital of France?")
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])

**Script**
import openai

## Set your API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

## Define the parameters for the request
prompt = "Write a short story about a robot who becomes sentient"
model = "text-davinci-002"

## Send the request to the API
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine=model,
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=2048,
    n = 1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.5
)

## Get the generated text from the response
generated_text = response["choices"][0]["text"]

## Print the generated text
print(generated_text)
