# rimraf

`rimraf` is a command-line tool for deleting files and directories recursively. It is similar to the `rm` command, but is more robust and can handle edge cases like deleting files with special characters or permissions.

## Basic Usage

To delete a file or directory using `rimraf`, you can use the following command:
`rimraf <file_or_directory>`


Replace `<file_or_directory>` with the path to the file or directory you want to delete. If the path contains spaces or other special characters, enclose it in quotes.

`rimraf` will delete the file or directory and all of its contents, so be careful when using this command.

## Advanced Usage

`rimraf` is a very powerful tool with many advanced features. Some examples of advanced usage include:

- Using globs to delete multiple files or directories at once (`rimraf *.txt`)
- Using the `--no-preserve-root` option to delete the root directory (be careful!)
- Using the `-v` option to enable verbose output

For more information about using `rimraf`, consult the documentation and man pages.
