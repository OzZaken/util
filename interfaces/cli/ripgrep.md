# Ripgrep

Ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a specified pattern.

It is designed to be fast and efficient, using `multi-threading` and `advanced search algorithms` to quickly scan through large files and directories.

## Installation

To install ripgrep, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [ripgrep GitHub page](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
2. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system.
3. Install the binary by following the instructions in the ripgrep documentation.

## Usage

To use ripgrep, simply open a terminal and type the following command:
`rg <pattern>`

Replace `<pattern>` with the search pattern you want to use.

For example, to search for the word "hello" in all files in your current directory and its subdirectories, you would use the following command:
`rg hello`


Ripgrep will output a list of all files that contain the search pattern, along with the line number and the line itself.

| Command               | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `rg <pattern> <file>` | Search for `<pattern>` in `<file>`.           |
| `rg -i <pattern>`     | Search for `<pattern>` case-insensitively.    |
| `rg -w <pattern>`     | Search for whole words matching `<pattern>`.  |
| `rg -l <pattern>`     | Only list the files that contain `<pattern>`. |
| `rg -n <pattern>`     | Show the line numbers for each match.         |
| `rg -c <pattern>`     | Show the number of matches for each file.     |

## Conclusion

Ripgrep is a powerful search tool that can save you a lot of time when searching through large files and directories. Give it a try and see how it can improve your workflow!
