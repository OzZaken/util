<h1>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h1>

HTML is a markup language that is used to create and structure content on the web, such as text, images, and multimedia.

In HTML, you define elements that represent different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
You use tags to define these elements, and then nest them inside each other to create a structured hierarchy.

For example, here's an example of HTML code that creates a simple webpage:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to go to Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```
HTML Tags:
HTML tags are used to mark up the content of a web page. They define the structure and appearance of the content, and they are enclosed in angle brackets. HTML tags have two parts: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the name of the element and any attributes that apply to it. The closing tag contains the name of the element preceded by a forward slash. For example, the HTML tag for a paragraph is <p>, and its closing tag is </p>.

HTML Elements:
HTML elements are made up of HTML tags and the content between them. An HTML element starts with an opening tag, followed by the content, and ends with a closing tag. The content can be text, images, videos, or other HTML elements. For example, a paragraph element consists of an opening <p> tag, the content, and a closing </p> tag.

In summary, HTML tags define the structure of the content, and HTML elements consist of the tags and the content between them. Understanding the difference between tags and elements is important for creating well-formed HTML documents.
