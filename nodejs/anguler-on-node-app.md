If you have a React app and want to use an Angular service in it, you'll need to take a few steps to integrate the Angular service with your React app.


One way to do this is to create an Angular library that contains the service, and then import and use the library in your React app. Here are the steps to create an Angular library and use it in a React app:



1. Create a new Angular library by running the following command in your terminal:

```perl
ng generate library my-library
```

2. Add the @angular/common/http module to your library by running the following command in your terminal:

```sql
ng add @angular/common
```

3. Create a new service file in your library, and add the code for the UnsplashService to it. Make sure to export the UnsplashService class from the file.

4. Build the Angular library by running the following command in your terminal:

```perl
ng build my-library
```

5. After the build is complete, you should have a compiled library in the dist directory of your Angular project. Copy the `my-library` directory from the dist directory to your React project's node_modules directory.

6. In your React app, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```css
npm install --save rxjs @angular/common@^12.0.0
```
