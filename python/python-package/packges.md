- os - This library provides a way to interact with the file system in Python. You can use it to navigate directories, create and delete files and directories, and more. For example, you might use os.listdir() to get a list of files in a directory, or os.path.join() to construct a path to a file or directory.

- shutil - This library provides higher-level file operations than the os library, such as copying and moving files and directories. You can use it to copy a directory and its contents, for example, or to move a file to a different location.

- glob - This library provides a way to search for files that match a particular pattern. You can use it to find all files with a certain extension, for example, or to find all files that match a certain naming convention.

- json - This library provides a way to read and write JSON data in Python. You might use it to store configuration information or other data in JSON format.

- yaml - This library provides a way to read and write YAML data in Python. YAML is a popular format for configuration files, and you might find it more human-readable than JSON in some cases.

- markdown - This library provides a way to parse and render Markdown-formatted text in Python. You might use it to convert your .md files to HTML or other formats for display on a website.

- pygments - This library provides syntax highlighting for code in various programming languages. You might use it to highlight code snippets in your Markdown files.
