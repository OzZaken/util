Create a virtual environment by running the command python -m venv env. This will create a new directory named env in your project directory that contains the Python interpreter and standard library files for the virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment by running the command `source env/bin/activate` on Linux/MacOS or `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
