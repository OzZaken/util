## Usage
To use Cloudinary, you first need to sign up for an account and obtain your API credentials. Once you have your credentials, you can use the Cloudinary API to upload, manage, and deliver your media assets.

Here's an example of how to upload an image to Cloudinary using JavaScript:

```javascript
const CLOUD_NAME = 'your_cloud_name';
const UPLOAD_PRESET = 'your_upload_preset';
const UPLOAD_URL = `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${CLOUD_NAME}/image/upload`;

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', file);
formData.append('upload_preset', UPLOAD_PRESET);

fetch(UPLOAD_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
    console.log(data);
})
.catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
});

```

Here's an example of how to upload an image using Cloudinary and Axios:

```javascript
const uploadImg = async (ev) => {
  const CLOUD_NAME = 'CLOUD_NAME'; // Insert yours
  const UPLOAD_PRESET = 'UPLOAD_PRESET'; // Insert yours
  const UPLOAD_URL = `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${CLOUD_NAME}/image/upload`;

  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', ev.target.files[0]);
  formData.append('upload_preset', UPLOAD_PRESET);

  try {
    const { data } = await axios.post(UPLOAD_URL, formData);
    const elImg = document.createElement('img');
    elImg.src = data.url;
    document.body.append(elImg);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('ERROR!', error);
  }
}
```
This function takes an event object ev, which contains information about the file to be uploaded. The function creates a FormData object and appends the file and the UPLOAD_PRESET value to it. Then, it sends a POST request to the Cloudinary API using the axios library.

If the request is successful, the function creates an img element and sets its src attribute to the URL of the uploaded image. Finally, it appends the img element to the document body.

Note that you can also use the fetch API instead of axios to send the request. The code would be very similar, but with some differences in syntax.

## NOTE:
Cloudinary also provides a number of other APIs and SDKs for different programming languages and platforms, including Node.js, PHP, Ruby,
