# ssh

`ssh` (Secure Shell) is a protocol for securely connecting to a remote server over an unsecured network.

It provides an encrypted communication channel for logging in to a remote server, executing commands, and transferring files.

## Basic Usage

To connect to a remote server using `ssh`, you can use the following command:
`ssh username@remote_host`


Replace `username` with your username on the remote server, and `remote_host` with the hostname or IP address of the remote server. You will be prompted to enter your password (unless you have set up key-based authentication).

Once you are connected to the remote server, you can execute commands and transfer files using the command-line interface.

## Advanced Usage

`ssh` is a very powerful tool with many advanced features. Some examples of advanced usage include:

- Using key-based authentication to avoid having to enter a password
- Setting up port forwarding to access a service on a remote server
- Configuring `ssh` to use a custom configuration file
