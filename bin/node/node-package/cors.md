CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This helps to prevent malicious web pages from performing unauthorized requests to sensitive data on another domain, which could potentially compromise user data and privacy.

The cors package is a Node.js module that provides middleware for Express, a popular web application framework, to enable CORS with various options. It allows you to specify which origins are allowed to make cross-origin requests to your server.

Here's an example of how to use cors in an Express application

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const app = express();

app.use(cors());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello from the server!" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```
In this example, cors() is used as middleware to enable CORS for all requests. By default, cors will allow requests from any origin. You can also pass an options object to cors to specify which origins are allowed, like this:
```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://example.com"
  })
);
```

This example allows requests only from http://example.com.

It's important to note that enabling CORS on the server does not guarantee that cross-origin requests will be allowed by the browser. The browser will still enforce the same-origin policy, but it will use the response from the server to determine whether the request is allowed or not.
