# prop-types
package in JavaScript that helps you to validate the data types of the properties passed to your React components. It helps to catch potential bugs and makes your code more maintainable by ensuring that the properties of your components are always used in a correct and consistent way.

Using prop-types is simple, you just need to import the package and then specify the data type of each prop that your component expects to receive. For example:

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string,
  age: PropTypes.number,
  onClick: PropTypes.func,
}
```

In this example, the component MyComponent is expecting to receive three props: name, age, and onClick. The data type of each prop is specified using the corresponding PropTypes property.
