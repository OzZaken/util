# RESTful API
REST (`Representational State Transfer`) is a software architecture style that is often used to design web services and APIs.

`RESTful APIs` use the `HTTP protocol` to transfer data between clients and servers, using HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` to perform `CRUD` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
