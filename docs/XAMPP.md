# XAMPP

[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) is a free and open-source software package that allows you to easily install and run a web server on your computer.
The name XAMPP is an acronym for the various components that make up the software stack:

X: Cross-platform, meaning it can run on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
A: Apache, the web server software
M: MySQL, the database management system
P: PHP, a popular server-side scripting language

In addition to these core components, XAMPP also includes other tools and utilities that are commonly used in web development, such as phpMyAdmin, a web-based interface for managing MySQL databases, and FileZilla, an FTP client for transferring files to and from the server.
# use
XAMPP is often used by developers who want to test their websites and applications locally before deploying them to a live server. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing the web server and database, and can be configured to support a wide range of web technologies and programming languages.
