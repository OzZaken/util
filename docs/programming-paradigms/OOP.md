<h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications.
It's a powerful programming technique that helps organize code, promotes code reuse, and makes it easier to maintain and modify complex systems.

# Objects
Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP. An object is an instance of a class, which contains data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data. In OOP, objects have properties and behavior, which can be used to model real-world objects or abstract concepts.

# Classes
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data members) and the behavior (methods) that all objects of that class will have. The attributes are variables that hold data, while the methods are functions that operate on that data.

# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface. This helps to ensure that the object is used correctly and prevents the data from being manipulated in unexpected ways.

# Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or derived class, while the class that is inherited from is called the superclass or base class.

# Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors, depending on the context in which they are used. This means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were of the same class, as long as they have the same interface.

# Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling them at a higher level of abstraction. In OOP, abstraction is achieved by hiding the implementation details of a class from its users, and only exposing a simple, easy-to-understand interface.

## Examples
Here are some examples of OOP concepts in action:

- A car can be modeled as an object with properties like make, model, and color, and methods like start and stop.
- A bank account can be modeled as an object with properties like balance and account number, and methods like deposit and withdraw.
- A person can be modeled as an object with properties like name, age, and address, and methods like walk and talk.
