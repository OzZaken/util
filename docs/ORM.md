# ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

technique that allows you to map data from a relational database to objects in your code. 
This helps to abstract away the complexities of working with a database, and makes it easier to work with your data in an object-oriented way.

ORM is commonly used in object-oriented programming languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby, where it can help simplify database interactions by allowing developers to work with databases using familiar object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, and methods.
